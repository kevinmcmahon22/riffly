# riffly
spotify app for learning riffs

## why
I wanted to make something that would help me when learning how to play a new song. using scrubbers is intensive and hard to get right, while using the skip buttons don't give enough granularity.

Users can set the chunk of a song they are focusing on by using timestamps, and loop that section as much as they want


## Ideas
user saved timestamps
"popular" timestamps for famous licks or song chrouses that people want to learn
a waveform scrubber (similar to soundcloud)
